# Letterboxd Normal Distributions

## Timeline


### Letterboxd API Closed Off Struggles
Sep 07 '23

So, as I've found before in years past, the [Letterboxd API](https://api-docs.letterboxd.com/) is [not available to the public](https://letterboxd.com/api-beta/) (yet?). So, for the data that I want, I might have to go spelunking.

As for what I am trying to get and determine, on a loose basis. I want to determine if the the average Letterboxd user has a normal distribution of their film ratings like [I do](https://letterboxd.com/hahaveryfun/). I see many that don't, so I just wanted to determine if that's odd.

Looks like my best option might be to look for a proxy service, or a pseudo-api that has just effectively written a web-scraper.
